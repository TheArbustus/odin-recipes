    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> <strong> <em> Pizza </strong></em>is a dish of <strong> Italian </strong> origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,
       cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
       which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
       A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12-to-15-inch) precooked pizza crust </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil </li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 pound bacon, cooked crisp, drained, pat-dried, and crumbled</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1  cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or Muenster cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 F. If using uncooked dough, shape on a baking sheet and bake for about 5 to 7 minutes once the oven is hot. Remove from oven and reserve. If using a prebaked crust, there's no need to bake before adding toppings.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet and saut√© onions and garlic until tender, about 6 to 7 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the flour, paprika, and pepper and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the sour cream, thyme, and marjoram leaves and cook until thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Stir in the mustard. </li>
        <li>Spread the sauce over the prebaked crust. </li>
        <li>Top with the bacon and cheeses. </li>
        <li>Bake for 9 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown on the sides, crisp at the bottom, and the cheeses are melted. </li>
        <li>Cut into your preferred shape and serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! </li>
